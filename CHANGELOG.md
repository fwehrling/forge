# Changelog

All notable changes to FORGE are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **French accents restored**: 7 occurrences of stripped accents in `/forge` SKILL.md (e->e, a->a, c->c encoding regression from v1.4.0)
- **Memory Protocol section restored**: Routing decision logging to forge-memory was accidentally removed
- **On Invocation Failure section restored**: Error handling for failed skill/agent invocations was accidentally removed
- **Router workflow restored to 6 steps**: Steps 2 (`.forge/` context check) and 5 (memory logging) were accidentally dropped, reducing workflow from 6 to 4 steps
- **README examples improved**: Router examples updated with more representative use cases (full pipeline, single story, quick fix)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-19

### Changed

- **`/forge` core skill**: Transformed from a documentary hub (230 lines listing commands) into an **intelligent router** (282 lines) that classifies user intent and automatically delegates to the right FORGE skill or custom agent. The user now types `/forge "anything"` and the router handles dispatch
- **Frontmatter description**: Rewritten with universal triggers covering dev, business, marketing, SEO, security, legal, and framework domains
- **Philosophy/Quick Start sections**: Replaced with a Router section defining core behavior — classify, select, invoke, never execute

### Added

- **Intent Classification system**: 4-dimension analysis (Domain, Action, Specificity, Scale) with 9 domain categories, 15 action verbs, 4 specificity levels, and 4 scale levels
- **Routing Table**: Complete dispatch table covering 6 target categories — Dev Pipeline (18 FORGE skills), Dev Tooling (4 skills), Business (Clara, Business Panel), Marketing (Maya, Theo, Leo, GEO Expert), Security (forge-audit vs Victor disambiguation), Legal (E-commerce Legal Expert), Framework (Angular Expert, Next.js Expert)
- **Invocation Protocol**: 3 mechanisms — Skill tool for FORGE skills, Task tool for custom agents, sequential chaining for 2-target requests (3+ delegates to forge-auto)
- **Dynamic Creation (professional-grade)**: Generates new agent files on-the-fly in `~/.claude/agents/` when no existing target matches. Created agents follow skill-creator best practices — full persona (name, expertise, frameworks), structured output templates, limits/boundaries, pushy description with trigger phrases, domain-appropriate color, and French language rules. Agents are invoked immediately and persist for future routing
- **Disambiguation Rules**: Decision table for ambiguous requests (security audit context detection, named agent routing, scope overflow to forge-auto)
- **Condensed Reference section**: Pipeline overview, tracks, and memory summary with links to detailed reference files

### Removed

- **Documentary content**: Agent Registry table, Agent Invocation Pattern, Scale-Adaptive Intelligence details, Workflows section, Autonomous Loops section, Persistent Memory section, Security Model section, MCP Integration section, Configuration section, full Reference Files listing — all moved to or already covered by `references/*.md`

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-08

### Changed

- **All 23 skill descriptions**: Rewritten with natural language trigger phrases ("Use when the user says..."), negative routing cases ("Do NOT use for... use /forge-X instead"), and pipeline context. Descriptions grew from 2-3 lines to 6-8 lines each, dramatically improving automatic skill triggering accuracy and disambiguation between similar skills (e.g., `/forge-quick-spec` vs `/forge-build`, `/forge-verify` vs `/forge-quick-test`, `/forge-party` vs `/forge-team party`)
- **French Language Rule**: Removed from 22 satellite skills — kept only in `/forge` (hub skill). Users configure language preferences in their `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, not per-skill
- **Step numbering**: Fixed non-standard numbering (1.5, 2.5, 5b, 5c) across `/forge-build`, `/forge-plan`, `/forge-status`, `/forge-update`, `/forge-verify` — all now use sequential integer numbering
- **Memory save blocks**: Replaced "MANDATORY — never skip" with explanations of WHY memory matters (e.g., "ensures QA verdicts persist for trend analysis and regression tracking") across all 14 agent skills
- **`/forge-review`**: Expanded from 35 to ~65 lines — added artifact-type-specific review lenses (code vs PRD vs architecture vs stories), severity classification (CRITICAL/WARNING/INFO), and structured report template with `file:line` references
- **`/forge-party`**: Expanded workflow — added available perspectives table, structured brief instructions for subagents, and synthesis report format template
- **`/forge-verify`**: Moved overly specific UI checks (hamburger menus, hover states, dropdowns) to QA persona reference; kept high-level pragmatic checks inline
- **`/forge-auto`**: Converted pseudo-code IF/ELSE block to imperative bullet-point style for better LLM consumption

### Added

- **Output format templates**: Added concrete ASCII report examples to 15 skills (`forge-build`, `forge-verify`, `forge-plan`, `forge-architect`, `forge-stories`, `forge-review`, `forge-deploy`, `forge-analyze`, `forge-ux`, `forge-audit`, `forge-loop`, `forge-quick-spec`, `forge-quick-test`, `forge-update`, `forge-audit-skill`). Previously only `forge-resume` had one
- **`/forge-memory`**: Added output examples for `status` and `search --pretty` commands
- **`/forge-party`**: Added available perspectives table (Architect, PM, Security, Dev, QA, Reviewer) with best-for guidance
- **`/forge-status`**: Added full sprint status table template with story breakdown, metrics, blockers, and backlog section

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- **`/forge` core skill**: Refactored SKILL.md — externalized detailed sections into modular reference files (`references/workflows.md`, `references/memory.md`, `references/security.md`, `references/loops.md`, `references/configuration.md`, `references/mcp-integration.md`), reducing main skill from ~800 to ~130 lines for faster loading
- **`/forge-audit-skill`**, **`/forge-init`**, **`/forge-review`**: Standardized usage syntax from `<param>` to `[param]` (bracket convention for optional parameters)
- **`/forge` SKILL.md**: Condensed Scale-Adaptive Intelligence section, simplified Agent Registry headers, streamlined pipeline diagram

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **`/forge-analyze`**: Structured idea intake (pre-analysis questionnaire) and concept validation & synthesis section (personas, USPs, positioning, MoSCoW, success metrics). Full market research framework: SWOT, Porter's 5 Forces, TAM/SAM/SOM, competitive landscape, go-to-market strategies
- **`/forge-plan`**: Agent Onboarding Protocol (Section 0), Gherkin/BDD acceptance criteria, AI-Human Interaction Protocol, MCP Catalog, design philosophy section
- **`/forge-build`**: First-story landing page suggestion (Y Combinator style) with hero, problem/solution, social proof, SEO basics
- **`/forge-ux`**: Structured design system template (colors HEX, typography scale, spacing, components, responsive breakpoints, dark mode, animations). Reference to `ai-design-optimization.md`
- **`/forge-verify`**: Pragmatic verification checks (link integrity, browser console audit, navigation testing, interactive elements, visual consistency, performance spot-check)
- **`/forge-quick-spec`**: Dual-track workflow — Bug Fix Track (root cause analysis, impact assessment, regression-first TDD, rollback plan) and Small Change Track
- `forge/references/ai-coding-optimization.md` — AI-friendly code patterns, documentation strategies, agent optimization
- `forge/references/ai-design-optimization.md` — YC-standard design guide, Tailwind CSS patterns, accessibility

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Managed FORGE section in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` with `<!-- FORGE:BEGIN -->` / `<!-- FORGE:END -->` markers
- `templates/claude-md-forge-section.md` as single source of truth for FORGE config block
- `scripts/inject-claude-md.sh` for injection/update with automatic backup and user confirmation
- New install step [3/6] to configure `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` during installation
- Step 5c in `/forge-update` to detect and propose FORGE section updates

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- `/forge-auto` now runs `/forge-verify` then `/forge-review` after each story build (was only verify)
- `/forge-team` pipeline and build patterns now spawn a dedicated Reviewer teammate alongside QA
- Task dependency chain per story: Dev → QA (`/forge-verify`) → Review (`/forge-review`)
- QA teammate prompt aligned with `/forge-verify` workflow (structured audit, verdicts, memory log)
- Review feedback loop: critical issues trigger fix → re-verify → re-review (max 2 cycles)
- Team size updated to 4 Dev + 1 QA + 1 Reviewer
