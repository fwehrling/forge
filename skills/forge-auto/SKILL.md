# /forge auto -- FORGE Autopilot Mode

FORGE takes full control of the development pipeline. It analyzes, decides,
executes, verifies, and iterates automatically until the objective is complete.

## Principle

```
The user provides an objective -> FORGE handles EVERYTHING else.
Planning -> Architecture -> Stories -> Code -> Tests -> Verification -> Deployment
```

## Workflow

1. **Load memory** (skip files already loaded in this conversation):
   - Read `.forge/memory/MEMORY.md` for project context
   - Read `.forge/sprint-status.yaml` for the current state
   - `forge-memory search "<current objective>" --limit 3` -- skip if similar search done

2. **Analyze state and determine the phase**:

   Inspect the project artifacts and sprint status, then execute the appropriate phase:

   - **No artifacts exist** -> Start with `/forge plan` (generates the PRD)
   - **PRD exists, no architecture** -> Launch `/forge architect`
   - **Architecture exists, no UX design** -> Launch `/forge ux`
   - **UX exists, no stories** -> Launch `/forge stories`
   - **Stories exist with "pending" status**:
     - Count unblocked pending stories
     - 2+ unblocked stories AND Agent Teams available -> Delegate to `/forge team build [STORY-IDs]` (parallel execution), then continue with QA
     - Otherwise -> Pick the next unblocked story, launch `/forge build STORY-XXX` (sequential)
   - **"in_progress" story exists** -> Resume `/forge build STORY-XXX`
   - **Story implemented (Dev tests pass)** -> Launch `/forge verify STORY-XXX`
   - **QA verdict = FAIL** -> Increment failure counter. Under 3 failures: fix and re-verify. At 3+ failures: escalate to `/forge loop "Fix STORY-XXX: [summary]" --mode hitl` which iterates with sandbox guardrails until tests pass
   - **QA verdict = PASS or CONCERNS** -> Launch `/forge review` on the story's source code (adversarial analysis)
   - **Review raises CRITICAL issues** -> Fix, re-run `/forge verify`, re-run `/forge review`
   - **Review is clean** -> Move to the next story
   - **All stories completed** -> Propose new stories or wrap up

3. **Execute with the appropriate agents**:
   - Each phase invokes the corresponding agent (PM, Architect, UX, SM, Dev, QA)
   - The agent produces its artifacts in `docs/` or `src/`
   - **Agent Teams acceleration**: when entering the build phase with 2+ unblocked stories,
     and `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set, autopilot delegates to
     `/forge team build` for parallel story implementation (up to 4 Dev + 1 QA).
     If Agent Teams is not available, stories are built sequentially as before.

4. **Automatic quality gates**:
   - After each story: lint + typecheck + tests > 80% coverage
   - After each /forge verify: mandatory QA verdict
   - After QA PASS/CONCERNS: mandatory /forge review (adversarial review)
   - If /forge review raises critical issues: fix -> re-verify -> re-review
   - **Loop escalation**: if 3 consecutive failures on the same story, autopilot
     delegates to `/forge loop` in HITL mode with the QA failure summary as task.
     forge-loop iterates with sandbox guardrails (cost cap, circuit breaker, rollback)
     until tests pass, then returns control to autopilot for re-verification.
   - Ultimate circuit breaker: if forge-loop also fails (hits its own circuit breaker)
     -> pause + report to user

5. **Save memory**:
   ```bash
   forge-memory log "Autopilot session: {completed}/{total} stories, phase {PHASE}" --agent autopilot
   ```
   - Update `.forge/sprint-status.yaml`

6. **Human checkpoints** (configurable):
   - Default: checkpoint after each major phase (plan, architecture, stories)
   - `--no-pause` mode: no checkpoints (full autopilot)
   - `--pause-stories` mode: pause after story decomposition
   - `--pause-each` mode: pause after each story

## Options

```bash
# Full autopilot -- FORGE decides everything
/forge auto

# Autopilot with a specific objective
/forge auto "Implement the authentication system"

# Autopilot without pauses (warning: fully autonomous)
/forge auto --no-pause

# Autopilot with pause after stories
/forge auto --pause-stories

# Autopilot with pause after each story
/forge auto --pause-each

# Resume autopilot after a pause
/forge auto --resume
```

## Progress Report

At each step, FORGE displays:

```
FORGE AUTOPILOT -- Progress
------------------------------
Phase     : Development (Story 3/8)
Last      : STORY-002 [OK] (QA: PASS)
Current   : STORY-003 -- Implementation
Next      : STORY-004 (pending)

Metrics:
  Stories   : 2 completed / 1 in_progress / 5 pending
  Tests     : 47 pass / 0 fail
  Coverage  : 87%

Memory    : .forge/memory/MEMORY.md (up to date)
Session   : .forge/memory/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

## How /forge auto Uses Other FORGE Tools

| Situation | Autopilot delegates to | Condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2+ unblocked stories ready | `/forge team build` (parallel) | Agent Teams enabled |
| 1 story ready | `/forge build STORY-XXX` (sequential) | Always |
| Story implemented (Dev tests pass) | `/forge verify STORY-XXX` (QA audit) | Always |
| QA verdict PASS/CONCERNS | `/forge review src/{MODULE}/` (adversarial review) | Always |
| Review raises critical issues | Fix -> `/forge verify` -> `/forge review` | Always |
| 3 consecutive failures on a story | `/forge loop` (iterative fix) | Always |
| forge-loop also fails | Pause + report to user | Ultimate circuit breaker |

## Difference with /forge loop

| Aspect         | /forge loop                     | /forge auto                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**      | A specific task                 | The entire project                      |
| **Decision**   | The user chooses the task       | FORGE decides the next action           |
| **Agents**     | A single one (usually Dev)     | All agents depending on the phase       |
| **Memory**     | Local fix_plan.md              | Persistent project memory               |
| **Progression**| Linear (iterations)            | Full pipeline (plan -> deploy)           |
| **Use case**   | "Implement this feature"       | "Build this project from A to Z"        |
| **Relation**   | Standalone or called by auto   | Calls /forge loop on difficult stories  |

## Coexistence with Manual Mode

Autopilot and manual commands are 100% compatible:

- You can start with `/forge auto`, pause, then continue manually
- You can work manually then launch `/forge auto --resume` to continue
- Memory is shared: both modes read/write the same files
- `/forge status` works in both modes

## Notes

- Autopilot respects quality gates without exception -- skipping a gate breaks the trust contract that lets `--no-pause` run unattended
- The circuit breaker protects against infinite loops
- Persistent memory ensures continuity between sessions
- Compatible with projects initialized via `/forge init`
- Also works for resuming existing projects (analyzes the state)

Flow progression is managed by the FORGE hub. This skill acts as a delegated orchestrator -- it is invoked by the hub and may load other satellites as part of its orchestration role.
